## Ciphers Included

- Caesar Cipher  
- Atbash Cipher  
- Affine Cipher  
- Vigen√®re Cipher  
- Gronsfeld Cipher  
- Beaufort Cipher  
- Autokey (Running Key) Cipher  
- August Cipher  
- Ngram Operations  
- Hill Cipher  
- Rail Fence Cipher  
- Route Cipher  
- Myszkowski Cipher  

##  How to Compile

```bash
gcc main.c -o ciphers
./ciphers
